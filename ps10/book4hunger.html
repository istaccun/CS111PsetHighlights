   <h3>The House of Hunger - Dambudzo Marechera</h3>
   <img src="http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UarTlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"><br>
   <p>Publication Year: 2013.  Page count: 159</p>
   <p>Winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize, 1979 and first published in 1978, The House of Hunger is a selection of interconnected short stories that tell of Zimbabwe in chaos. In a style somewhat reminiscent of Joyce's Dubliners, the stories deal with psychological and social alienation. Dambudzo Marechera's work is not material typically associated with African literature. His stories are psychologically, rather than politically, motivated as his depictions of living in exile and outsiderhood show.</p>

   <h3>Hunger - Sean Kelly</h3>

   <p>Sean Kelly is recognised as one of the top ten professional cyclists of all time and inspired admiration and respect from his rivals, not just because of the races he won but the manner he conducted himself. Born and raised on a farm in rural Ireland, Kelly identified cycling as an escape route to a different, possibly better life. He turned professional in 1977 and his career spanned 18 seasons. His victories in the toughest single-day Classics, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Milan-San Remo and the Tour of Lombardy - known as the monuments of the cycling world - earned him the nickname King Kelly.</p>

   <p>Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, the remains of what used be the United States. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When Kat's sister is chosen by lottery, Kat steps up to go in her place.</p>

   <p>Publication Year: 2008.  Page count: 273</p>
   <p>Every day, we wake up hungry. Every day, we break our fast. Hunger is both a natural and an unnatural human condition. In Hunger, Sharman Apt Russell explores the range of this primal experience. Step by step, Russell takes us through the physiology of hunger, from eighteen hours without food to thirty-six hours to three days to seven days to thirty days. In quiet, elegant prose, she asks a question as big as history and as everyday as skipping lunch: How does hunger work?</p>

   <p>Post-Auschwitz biblical hermeneutic by Johann Baptist Metz and Dorothee Solle is set in dialogue with Post-colonial biblical hermeneutic focusing on resistance against destruction of biblical text through fascist or colonial interpretation. This dialogue is brought into the self-implicative dynamic of Biblical Spirituality research, reflecting the authors own context of engaging biblical text.</p>

   <p>How has the act of eating become a metaphor for compliance, starvation the language of protest? How does the rejection of food become the rejection of intolerable social constraints?
