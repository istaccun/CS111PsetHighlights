   <p class="description">When Father Gumede, known as Priest, loses his job as a farmhand, he realises he can’t afford to love his neighbour as he does himself. Despondent and enraged, Priest cuts off all ties to the church and politics, determined to make a living – at whatever cost. It will take a strange story written by his son Sandile – a comical, terrifying and prophetic tale in which the downtrodden rise up to march on the wealth of a neighbouring suburb – to show Priest the hope and humanity inherent in the human spirit. Beautifully poetic, funny and highly relevant, Nkosinathi Sithole’s debut novel highlights the ongoing plight of many rural South Africans and the power of a community working together to br...</p>

   <p class="description">Sean Kelly is recognised as one of the top ten professional cyclists of all time and inspired admiration and respect from his rivals, not just because of the races he won but the manner he conducted himself. Born and raised on a farm in rural Ireland, Kelly identified cycling as an escape route to a different, possibly better life. He turned professional in 1977 and his career spanned 18 seasons. His victories in the toughest single-day Classics, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Milan-San Remo and the Tour of Lombardy - known as the monuments of the cycling world - earned him the nickname King Kelly.</p>

   <p>Publication Year: <strong>2013</strong>. Page count: 159.</p>
   <p class="description">Winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize, 1979 and first published in 1978, The House of Hunger is a selection of interconnected short stories that tell of Zimbabwe in chaos. In a style somewhat reminiscent of Joyce's Dubliners, the stories deal with psychological and social alienation. Dambudzo Marechera's work is not material typically associated with African literature. His stories are psychologically, rather than politically, motivated as his depictions of living in exile and outsiderhood show.</p>

As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When Kat's sister is chosen by lottery, Kat steps up to go in her place.</p>

   <p class="description">"What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by?" -- Katniss Everdeen, The Hunger Games The Hunger Games trilogy captivates its audience through a storyline dominated by the quest for food, with the vast culinary disparity between the impoverished districts and the opulent Capitol taking center stage. For the Hunger Games characters, food is both a weapon and an act of love, and -- as in today's world -- it is essential to survival.
