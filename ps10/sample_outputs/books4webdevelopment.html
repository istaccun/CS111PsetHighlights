   <p class="description">As the majority of Java developers are only Web-tier developers; Java technologies like JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), and Apache Tomcat are mainly applicable and relevant to their needs. This comprehensive and user-friendly book is the first and maybe even the only starter-level work of its kind combining the naturally complimentary JSP, JSF and Tomcat Web technologies into one consolidated treatment for developers focusing on just Java Web application development and deployment. This book is examples-driven using practical, real-time e-commerce case studies and scenarios throughout.</p>
